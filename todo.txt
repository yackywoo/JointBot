ML design

1. uses random forest algorthim, works well against overfitting and noisy data ()
2. retrain entire ML using ALL historical data (until old data becomes stale)
3. batch the training to every wk or so? 
    - training on data where joints dont hurt is relevant 
    - training on data where joints DO hurt is releveanter
4. pain modeling
    - pain usually lasts for entire duration of THAT day
    - system that pings? before EOD (at a random time? at 7pm? let them choose?) asking for pain level
    - do another ping the NEXT day (early morning? mid afternoon? 12pm?) if pain still there
    - if pain is still there , ask to rate. 
    - REPEAT, PING BEFORE EOD, PING NEXT DAY .... INFINITE LOOP IF PAIN
        - NO PAIN = NO PING
